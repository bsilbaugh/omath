Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Omath is an aggregation of Ocaml utilities to support numerical modeling.

Status
~~~~~~

Omath is in a highly experimental stage of development: the API is highly
unstable, and there may be critical "bugs".

Building
~~~~~~~~

Running ocamlbuild in the toplevel directory should suffice to build the
library locally; e.g.

    $ ocamlbuild omath.cmo

Installation via a package manager, such as findlib, is not yet supported.
