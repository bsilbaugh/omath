Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Omath is an aggregation of Ocaml utilities to support numerical modeling.

Status
~~~~~~

Omath is in a experimental stage of development: the API is highly
unstable, and there may be critical "bugs".

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the command "make" in the top level of the source tree to build
omath via ocamlbuild, or execute ocamlbuild directly; e.g.

    ocamlbuild omath.cma

Executing the command "make install" will install omath via findlib.
